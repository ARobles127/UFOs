## Overview of the project 

This project has been developed with the purpose of sharing information based on data about events of humans encountering UFOs. In order to make this project efficient and accessible to anybody interested in the subject we are going to use JavaScript and HTML to create a website that contains a dataset from which users can pull information filtered by different criteria. 
We aim to give access to an  interactive and easy to operate website that will help Dana share her passion about UFO sightings and coding.    



## Results

Initially the website displayed information clicking one single button, users were only able to search results based on any random data. Now, the redesigned website allows users to search criteria based on four more elements, city, state, country, and shape, as well as use the home button to reload the website.

#### Home Button

The Home button, located on the top left corner  has the capability to reload the website and clear the search buttons.  


#### Filter Search

The Filter Search has been updated and contains four more elements that can be used independently from one another. Users can enter one single parameter to search through the dataset, or can enter information on all the five buttons to get more specific data.


#### Table

![Filtered_Table](https://github.com/ARobles127/UFOs/blob/main/Filtered_Table.png) 



The table does not have any updates. The information is presented in a clean and organized manner that allows users to read through the data that is categorized by columns and rows. 



## Summary

The website accomplishes two goals: Dana’s idea of creating a website that  presents her findings on the UFO sightings, and allowing users to friendly navigate through the website to pull data on a well structured table. However, there is always room for improvement and this website is not the exception. One  drawback of this design is the “Filter Search” bar that can mislead users to think that they have to input all the criteria in order to pull information. Along with the search button we have two more recommendations to redesign the website and deliver a much pleasant experience to future users. 
 
#### Recommendations for further development

- Recommendation one: The Filter Search bar criteria can be reduced to only relevant elements, in order to accomplish this task a deep analysis of the data will be required to consider elements such as “Country” and “ Shape”. Since there are no parameters to guide the user to search for a type of shape or if there is information of UFOs from other countries, then these two buttons could be removed. 


- Recommendation two: If we remove certain elements from the Filter Search then there will be room to integrate a button to click and start the search. Along with a brief explanation on the paragraph above the table that instructs the user of the type of information that can be found when using the Filter Search bar.
